# Keeper‑League Rulebook

## 1. League Fees & Keeper Allowance
| # of Keepers | Total Entry Fee | Incremental Cost | Notes |
|--------------|---------------:|-----------------:|-------|
| 0 – 1 | $150 | — | Base entry; keepers optional |
| 2 | $175 | +$25 | Second keeper discounted |
| 3 | $225 | +$50 | Third keeper |
| 4 (max) | $300 | +$75 | Fourth keeper |

*Your entry fee covers the league pot **plus** the “salary” of any keepers beyond the first two.*

## 2. Keeper Eligibility & Round‑Value Table
1. **Eligibility** – Any player on your roster **after Week 17** is eligible.  
2. **Round value** is based on where that player was *originally drafted last season* and translated using the table below.  
3. **Undrafted / waiver pickups** default to a **6th‑round** keeper value.

| Drafted Last Year → | Keeper Round This Year |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 5 | 4 |
| 6 | 5 |
| 7 | 6 |
| 8 | 6 |
| 9 | 7 |
| 10 | 8 |
| 11 | 9 |
| 12 | 10 |
| 13 | 10 |
| 14 | 10 |
| 15 | 11 |
| 16 | 11 |
| 17 | 11 |
| Undrafted | 6 |
| Free Agent | 6 |
| Waiver | 6 |

* Each time you keep the same player, re‑apply this table to their new “draft round.”  
* Late steals eventually rise into premium rounds so the talent pool stays fresh.

## 3. Duplicate‑Round Tie‑Breaker
If multiple keepers carry the same round value:

* **First** player occupies that round.  
* **Second** slides to the next open round, and so on.  
* In future seasons, all of those players are treated as if they were drafted in the **original** keeper round (they’ll rise together).

---

## 4. Draft Order & Slot Selection
* **Draft order is finalized *before* keepers lock.**  
  *The league still uses the “choice order” table based on last year’s standings, but managers select their slots **prior** to submitting keepers.*

When you keep a player, their round cost consumes your pick in that slot.

> **Example**: You own pick 4.04 but keep a player costing a 4th. That keeper occupies 4.04; your next live pick is 5.04.

## 5. Declaring Keepers & Payment
| Milestone | Deadline / Detail |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Draft order posted | Commissioner sets & announces when the league re‑opens |
| **Keeper submissions** | Select in Sleeper **48 hours before the draft** |
| **Payment** | Extra‑keeper fees are due *with* the declaration. Unpaid keepers are voided. |
| Keeper grid published | Within 12 hours of the keeper deadline |

---

## 6. Trades & Transactions
* **In‑season trades** do **not** change a player’s keeper round.  
* **Off‑season trades** are allowed and handled based on timing:
  * **Before the keeper-declaration deadline** – The player’s **new** team must decide whether to keep them.
    * If they keep him, he occupies one of that manager’s keeper slots and costs the appropriate draft round (plus any extra keeper fee).
    * If they choose *not* to keep him, he simply re-enters the draft pool.

    _Example_: On **June 15** (two weeks before the keeper deadline) **Team A** trades WR **Stefon Diggs** (eligible **4th-round** keeper) and a 9th-round pick to **Team B** for RB **Derrick Henry** (eligible **2nd-round** keeper). When the deadline arrives Team B keeps Diggs at a 4th-round cost, while Team A keeps Henry at a 2nd-round cost. Draft picks from the trade remain with their new teams.

  * **After the keeper-declaration deadline (but before the draft)** – Keepers are already locked and paid for, so incoming players **do not** count against the acquiring team’s keeper limit.
    * The acquiring team gets the player “as-is” and still has all of its own keeper slots available.

    _Example_: On **August 25** (the day after keepers lock) **Team C** trades a 2nd-round pick to **Team D** for QB **Jalen Hurts**, who was already declared as D’s 5th-round keeper. Team C now rosters Hurts but he does **not** reduce their keeper allotment; Team D gains the 2nd-round pick for the upcoming draft. Team C no longer holds their 2nd round pick.
* **Draft‑pick trading** — Draft pick trading is allowed, but comes with a few careful considerations
  * **Entry-Fee Insurance**
    * If you trade away any future draft pick (regardless of what you get back), you must immediately pay 50 % of next season’s buy-in.
    * Payment is non-refundable and is credited toward your entry fee the following year.
    * Example: Team A ships its 6th-round pick for a win-now RB. Team A pays \$75 now (half of \$150) to lock in its spot for next season.
  * **Keeper-Round Integrity**
    * To keep a player you must still own the exact round that player costs.
    * If that pick is gone, “slide up” to the next earlier round you *do* own as is available to use.
    * Only that season’s cost slides up; the player’s long-term keeper round doesn’t change.
    * Examples:
      * *Slide-Up Example (single keeper)*
        * → You traded away your 4th-round pick. You want to keep WR Chris Olave (4th-round cost). Olave now costs your 3rd-round pick.
      * *Slide-Up Example (multiple keepers)*
        * → You’ve already kept RB Etienne in the 3rd, and the 4th is traded away. You still want to keep Olave (4th cost). Olave slides to your 2nd-round pick (the next earlier one you own). Etienne remains in the 3rd. Next Year: both Olave and Etienne advance based on their original keeper rounds (4th and 3rd), not the temporary slide-up rounds.
* **Dropping a player** - All players dropped from their rosters after the draft will retain their keeper eligibility & round-value per the table if they are added by a new team. There is no resetting values or any rules that would make a player who is (a) dropped, (b) claimed on waivers, or (c) cleared waivers receive any special keeper value treatment for the following year.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions
| Question | Quick Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| Can I keep a player forever? | Yes |
| What if I keep three players with the same round value? | They slide successively (e.g., 3 4th Round Keepers occupy R4, R5, R6) **as long as** the team hasn't traded away any of those picks. If R6 was traded away, then in order to keep all 3 players it would take R3, R4, and R5. |
| How do I submit keepers? | Via Sleeper “Keepers” tab & confirmed with commissioner with payment. |
| Can I trade picks from two years out? | No — only next year's draft picks may be traded. |
| Do I pay the 50% insurance every time I trade a pick? | No — it's charged once per season on your first outgoing pick trade. |
| What if I trade a pick away and later reacquire that round? | Insurance isn’t refunded; owning that round again restores normal keeper costs. |
| Can the insurance deposit transfer to a new manager? | Yes — it stays with the franchise and credits the next manager. |
| Do undrafted waiver pickups always cost a 6th round? | Yes — any undrafted player defaults to a 6th-round keeper cost, reguardless if it's through free agency or waivers (FAAB). |
| What if two keepers need the same round after a pick trade? | Apply duplicate-round rule: first keeps that round, next slides up. |
| When is the 50% insurance fee due? | Within 24 hours of trade approval; unpaid trades are reversed. |
